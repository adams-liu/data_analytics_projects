## Powerline Fault Detection :electric_plug:

Partial discharges (PD) in power grids can cause damages to the electrical assets, as well as power outages or even fires.
Therefore, it is crucial to detect partial discharges early so that they can be repaired. The goal of this project is to design a model that
detects partial discharges in voltage readings. In this paper, we propose a manual feature extraction based model using characteristics
of peaks in the signal.
